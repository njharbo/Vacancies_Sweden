\section{Relationship between vacancies and hires on the plant-level}
\label{sec:basic_rel}

\subsubsection{Descriptive statistics}

\input{./tex/tables/hire_rate_vacancy_rate_vacancy_yield.tex}

Table \ref{tab:vacancy_yield} presents the hiring rate, the vacancy rate and the vacancy yield in the cross-section of plants. The hiring and vacancy rate is expressed as the number of hires and vacancies per employee, while the vacancy yield is the number of hires per vacancy. Across industries the vacancy yield is lowest within construction where the yield is $1.37$ hires per vacancies, while it is highest within manufacturing where the rate is $3.43$. Across plant size, as measured by number of employees, larger firms hire more workers per vacancies. Indeed, while the plants in the decile with fewest employees only hire $0.3$ workers per vacancy, the plants in the decile with most employees hire $4.02$ workers per vacancy. This result contracts the findings from the United States, where the vacancy yield is found to be \emph{decreasing} in plant \citep{Moscarini2016, Davis2013}. Across turnover, measured on the firm level, a similar pattern is seen: plants in firms with larger turnover have a higher vacancy yield.

TBD: Why is yield not just hires/vacancies?
TBD: Do Table 1 with PES vacancies

There are a number of potential explanations behind this observed heterogeneity in vacancy yields. First, plants may rely on other recruitment channels than vacancies, such as uninvited applications or informal social networks. In case the reliance on such alternative recruitment varies across plant characteristics this may give rise to the pattern observed in Table \ref{tab:vacancy_yield}. For example \cite{Cahuc2009} construct a model, where an employer's probability of filling a job is increasing in the size of the social network. To the extent that larger plants have larger social networks this can potentially go some way in explaining why the vacancy yield is increasing in plant size. Second, plants may rely on one vacancy to hire more than one worker. If a plant is attempting to hire workers with a homogenous skill set, it may only report one vacancy in spite on an intention to hire more than one worker. Such a behavior would predict a higher vacancy yield in industries, where the required skill set of workers is more homogenous.

Next, I show how the number of hires varies with vacancies in the cross section of plants. Figure \ref{fig:crossplot} depicts the raw relationship between vacancies and hires in the following month on the plant level. Here each dot on the y-axis represents the average number of hires for the number of vacancies represented on the x-axis. This relationship appears concave, rather than linear,  which suggests that one additional vacancy predicts less and less hiring. TBD: In Figure \ref{fig:crossplot_panel} in the Appendix, I depict the similar relationship but for each year. For most years the concave relationship is still seen.

\end{figure}

In addition many hires happen in plants which did not report any vacancies. Figure \ref{fig:share_without} shows the share of all hires that are made in plants that did not report any vacancies in the preceding month. This share varies in the interval 40 \% - 50 \%, and falls to 30 \% - 40 \% if counting the share of hires that are made without any vacancies in the two preceding months (TBD: Add figure). Some of these hires can be accounted by hiring out of other channels than vacancies, but some might also be explained by time-aggregation issues. Indeed, since I only observe the stock of vacancies at a given point in time hiring may happen out of newly created vacancies that do not enter into the dataset. I will address this issue in Section \ref{sec:time_agg}.

\end{figure}

These initial descriptive statistics hint at (1) the distribution of vacancies play an important role and (2) our vacancy may not capture all job-openings in the economy. Usually, we look at the sum of all vacancies to gauge the number of job-openings in the economy. However, the descriptive statistics reported above suggests that this is potentially misleading. Indeed, if the observed variation the vacancy yield is caused by variation in the underlying number of actual job-openings, then we need to account for the distribution when using vacancies as a measure of total job-openings in the economy. Moreover, the large share of hiring in plants without preceding vacancies also suggests that vacancies is an incomplete measure of job-openings.

\subsubsection{Estimating a hiring equation on the plant level}

I now turn to the estimation of the relationship between vacancies and hires on the plant level. In the textbook search and matching model aggregate hiring is determined by the matching of unemployed workers $(U)$ and job-openings $(V)$. This matching is done via an aggregate matching function with constant returns to scale $(M(U,V))$. Assuming plant homogeneity, the number of hires in plant $j$ at time $t$ can then be written as 
%\footnote{As presented \emph{e.g.} in \cite{Pissarides2000}}
\begin{align}
H(t, j)=\underbrace{\frac{M(U(t-1),V(t-1))}{V(t-1)}}_{(1)} \underbrace{V(t-1,j)}_{(2)}
\label{eq:ht+1}
\end{align}
Here the number of hires in plant $j$ at time $t$ is a function of (1) the tightness on the aggregate labor market\footnote{The definition of labor market tightness is often cause of confusion. Here I follow conventions and define labor market tightness as \emph{number of job-openings per unemployed worker}.} and (2) number of job-openings posted by the plant.

Two predictions follow from equation \eqref{eq:ht+1}. First, the number of hires made by plant $j$ at time $t$ is linear in the number of job-openings posted by the plant. The coefficient on job-openings is inversely related to labor market tightness, such that a tighter labor market predicts fewer hires per job-opening. Second, we should only see hiring in plants where the number of job-openings is positive. As explained above these predictions appear to be at odds with the data. In the estimations below, I will address this by allowing for a non-linear relationship between vacancies and hires, and in Section \ref{sec:time_agg} I will investigate how much of the hiring without vacancies that can be accounted for by time-aggregation. 

When estimating \eqref{eq:ht+1} one has to take a stance on the appropriate interval between vacancy and relevant hire. To guide this choice, I rely on information on the duration of vacancies posted at the Public Employment Service (Figure \ref{fig:PES_duration}). The average duration of vacancies posted here is 18 days, and 85 \% of all durations are less than a month. Informed by these findings, I set the interval between vacancy and hire to month. I will however vary this interval to check robustness in Section \ref{sec:time_agg}.

\begin{figure}[t]

\end{figure}

To identify \eqref{eq:ht+1} in a flexible manner, I will estimate the following equation using the plant-level data.
\begin{align}
H(t,j)=\alpha(t-1) V(t-1,j)^{\gamma}
\label{eq:estimation_equation}
\end{align}
Here $\alpha(t-1)$ is a time fixed effect, which captures the aggregate conditions in equation \eqref{eq:ht+1}. $\gamma$ is an exponent on plant-level vacancies, which allows for the possibility of a non-linear relationship between hires and vacancies. Insofar that the relationship is linear we should estimate a $\gamma$ of unity.

Identifying \eqref{eq:estimation_equation} involves a choice of estimation strategy. One option is to estimate \eqref{eq:estimation_equation} in logs using ordinary least squares. This, however, comes at the cost of loosing all observations with zero hires and/or vacancies. Another option is to estimate \eqref{eq:estimation_equation} in levels using non-linear least squares. This allows for the inclusion of all observations in the regression. Below I report the results from both estimation methods. % Therefore, including observations with zero vacancies is likely only to decrease the fit of the model - not change the estimated parameters. 

The estimation results are reported in the first column of Table \ref{tab:main_ols} and \ref{tab:main_nls}. In both estimations the exponent on vacancies is far below unity, which speaks against a linear relationship between vacancies and hires. Notice that the fit of the model estimated via ordinary least squares is substantially better than that estimated via non-linear least squares, which is witnessed by the much lower adjusted $R^2$ in Table \ref{tab:main_nls} \emph{vis-a-vis} Table \ref{tab:main_ols}. This is explained by the fact that the non-linear least square estimator includes all observations with zero hires or vacancies, while these observations are excluded in the ordinary least square estimator. Given the functional form of \ref{eq:estimation_equation} this is bound to decrease the fit of the model. Also notice that most of the explanatory power in both estimations stems from the time-fixed effect. Indeed, in the estimation using ordinary least squares the adjusted $R^2$ falls from 0.27 to 0.03, when removing the time-fixed effects.

\subsubsection{Can we improve the measure of job-openings?}

The findings in Table \ref{tab:main_ols} and \ref{tab:main_nls} above show that the relationship between vacancies and hires on the plant level is weak and non-linear. Moreover, the descriptive statistics in Table \ref{tab:vacancy_yield} pointed to the distribution being important for the job-content of the sum of observed vacancies. Specifically, the number of hires per vacancy was increasing in the plant size. A natural next question is thus, whether it is possible to construct an alternative measure of job-openings, which is able to better predict hiring on the plant level. 

To investigate this, I will allow job-openings to be a function of not only vacancies, but also of plant size as well as other plant and firm level characteristics. Specifically, I will estimate the following relationship. 
\begin{align}
\tiny
H(j,t)&=\frac{M\left[U(t-1), V(t-1)\right]}{V(t-1)} F\left[ V(j,t-1), \mathbf{x}(t-1) \right] 
\label{eq:ht+1_aug} \\
F\left[V(j,t-1),\mathbf{x}(t-1)\right]&=V(j,t-1)^{\gamma_1}  \times  S(j,t-1)^{\gamma_2} \times T(j,t-1)^{\gamma_3} \times  Va(j,t-1)^{\gamma_4} \nonumber
\end{align}

This relationship between hires and job-openings in \eqref{eq:ht+1_aug} is an augmented version of that in equation \eqref{eq:ht+1}. Whereas job-openings in equation \eqref{eq:ht+1} were measured as posted vacancies only, job-openings in \eqref{eq:ht+1_aug} are measured by the function $F\left[ V(j,t-1), \mathbf{x}(t-1) \right]$, in which job-openings is allowed to be a function of where posted vacancies $V(j,t)$, plant size  $S_{jt}$, firm turnover $T_{jt}$ and firm value-added  $Va_{jt}$. Aggregate labor market conditions are again captured in the term $\frac{M\left[U(t-1), V(t-1)\right]}{V(t-1)}$ and will be modeled as a time-fixed effect in the regressions.

Equation \eqref{eq:ht+1_aug} is estimated using ordinary least squares as well as using non-linear least squares in collumn 2-5 of Table \ref{tab:main_ols} and \ref{tab:main_nls}. From column 2 to 5, I gradually allow job-openings to be a function of more plant and firm level characteristics in addition to vacancies. Two results stand out from this exercise. First, the ability to predict hiring on the plant level is substantially improved when allowing job-openings to depend also on plant and firm characteristics. This is witnessed by the increase in the adjusted $R^2$. Second, including these additional plant and firm variables decrease the exponent on vacancies towards $0$. These two results are especially driven by plant size. Indeed, most of the increase in the fit, and decrease in the exponent on vacancies, comes from the inclusion of plant size in the regression. Relatively little additional fit is achieved from including the other firm and plant level variables. 

One might be concerned that these results are driven by data selection, rather than explanatory power from the firm and plant level characteristics. Indeed, the number of observations drop as more variables are included Table \ref{tab:main_ols} and \ref{tab:main_nls}. Hence, one concern is that the better fit is not driven by the inclusion of  plant and firm characteristics, but instead the drop in number of observations. TBD: To ensure this is not the case, I restrict attention to the subset of data where all variables are available in Table TBD. This does not alter my results. 

The results in this section suggest that we can improve our measure of job-openings by taking plant characteristics as well as vacancies into account. Indeed, allowing job-openings to be a function of vacancies and plant size substantially improves our ability to predict hiring on the plant level. Specifically, the regressions showed that a measure of job-openings, which combines vacancies and plant size in the following form
\begin{align}
F(V(j,t), size(j,t))=V(j,t-1)^{a} size(j,t-1)^{b}
\label{eq:alt_opening_measure}
\end{align}
outperformed the traditional vacancy in its ability to predict hiring on the plant level. In equation \eqref{eq:alt_opening_measure}
$a$ is effectively zero and $b$ is between $0.4$ and $0.5$ (TBD: Check). That $a$ is effectively zero means that $V_{jt}^{a}$ effectively takes the form of a $0/1$ variable, which is $0$ when the plant reports $0$ vacancies and $1$ as soon as the plant reports any positive number of vacancies. This binary variable is then multiplied with $size_{jt}^{b}$, which is a concave function of plant size. 

Thus, the takeaway from the regressions in this section is that we should be concerned about three questions when wanting to predict hiring in a given plant: (1) what are the aggregate conditions on the labor market\footnote{As captured in the term $M(U(t),V(t))/V(t)$, which in the regressions is modelled as a time fixed effect.}, (2) whether or not the plant has any vacancies and (3) the size of the plant.
