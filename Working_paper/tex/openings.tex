\section{Openings}

In this section I document the relationship between job-openings as measured in the survey and in the data from the Public Employment Service (PES). For all figures I restrict the sample to the period 2004-2012, in which reporting to the survey is mandatory.

Figure X-XX shows the distribution of vacancies measured in the survey and PES, respectively and jointly.

Figure X shows the cross plot of survey and PES vacancies.

What explains this?

Table X reports the ratio of openings in the PES to openings in the survey across sectors, firm size, turnover and valueadded.
